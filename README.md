🚧 **Under Construction** 🚧

</div>

A modular game engine built on top of [TypeGPU](https://typegpu.com) & [Koota](https://github.com/pmndrs/koota), pushing the capabilities of JavaScript/TypeScript in graphics and general-purpose GPU compute for game development.

## Apps
- [Bionic Jolt](/apps/bionic-jolt) - a game project that drives the initial set of features that *wayfare* should have (3D primitives, collision detection, cameras, etc...).

## Packages
- [wayfare](/packages/wayfare) - the engine itself.
